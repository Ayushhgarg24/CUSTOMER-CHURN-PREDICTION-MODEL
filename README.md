# CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION
 My first Machine Learning project. Built and deployed models with 85% accuracy using Python and scikit-learn to predict customer churn, enabling targeted retention efforts.
 This project uses Lazy Predict Model 
and many ML algorithms like AdaBoost (85% accuracy), Decision Tree (78% accuracy), Random forest (85% accuracy).
